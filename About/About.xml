	<description>Thank you for downloading my mod! You are amazing!

To report any issues please refer to the mod page which I check every minute :) :) : )

Ever wondered what happens to all equipment pawns use? I mean, sure, it pops up when pawn is drafted but vanishes as soon as danger passes! Well, not anymore. Holsters takes care of this issue by displaying each colonist's weapon on their backs/belts!

&lt;size=22&gt;Overview:&lt;/size&gt;
- [b]Equipped items are displayed at all times just like apparel[/b] adding to the immersive aspects of the game.
- Extensive mod settings allow for adjusting positions of items, so you are not stuck with my default settings! :)

&lt;size=22&gt;Compatibility:&lt;/size&gt;
This mod can be added to/removed from existing saves without problems.

Have fun with my mod and happy holsteringâ€¦ ;)
